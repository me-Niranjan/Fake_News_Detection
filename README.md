# Fake_News_Detection
The project system aims to identify whether a claimed news is fake or real by verifying it with trusted sources.

Our system is:
 An evidence‑based fact verification system that:
 Takes a news claim
 Searches trusted online sources
 Compares claim with evidence using ML/NLP
 Outputs Real / Fake / Not Enough Info

“How does your system work?”
 “Our system extracts a claim, retrieves trusted online evidence, applies machine‑learning‑based semantic similarity and natural language inference models to verify the claim, and outputs an evidence‑backed verdict with confidence.”
